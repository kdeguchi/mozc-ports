# Latest version mozc for FreeBSD ports

The latest version of mozc is available for use on FreeBSD.
Fcitx5 is also supported, so you can get the source code from https://github.com/fcitx/mozc.
I can guarantee that Fcitx5 which I use regularly will work,
but I can't guarantee that the others will work,
only that poudriere will build everything.
